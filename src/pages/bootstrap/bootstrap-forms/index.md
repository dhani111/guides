Bootstrap's Default Settings
Form controls automatically receive some global styling with Bootstrap:

All textual <input>, <textarea>, and <select> elements with class .form-control have a width of 100%.

Bootstrap Form Layouts
Bootstrap provides three types of form layouts:

Vertical form (this is default)
Horizontal form
Inline form
Standard rules for all three form layouts:

Wrap labels and form controls in <div class="form-group"> (needed for optimum spacing)
Add class .form-control to all textual <input>, <textarea>, and <select> elements
